This repository will hold a series of apps, each demonstrating a feature(s) of android.

<ol>
<li>
	<b>GeoQuiz</b> - a basic app that exists to demo Toast.makeText(...) via a Button press.
</li>
<li>
	<b>GeoQuiz v1.1</b> - This version shows onClickListener in 2 forms, looping through a list of 
	ResId's with mod to display text, it also shows how to organize widgets using sub-LinearLayouts,
	and how to add images to buttons.
</li>
<li>
	<b>GeoQuiz v1.2</b> - This app shows the full life cycle of the app by using Log.d(...) and Log.i(...). 
	It also demonstrates how the custom horizontal layout can look different from protrait layout
	and how its opened when the device is rotated.Finally the app also shows how to save primitive types.
</li>
<li>
	<b>GeoQuiz v2.0</b> - This app displays how to call another activity which must call back when it
	leaves the stack (ie. is finished). Intent construction encapsulation is also on display inside the 
	cheat Activity. The Cheat activity builds intents for those that wish to call it and it unpacks
	intents that it has created for those that need it. Intents also include exta data the next activity
	might need. The cheatActivity should now display differntly the results if SDK 21+ is used.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Criminal Intent (work on-going...)</b>
	<br/>- update v1.3 - Refined the use of viewHolder and RecyclerView. I've added the adapter so one item 
	in the list refreshes when a change to a crime has occured.
	<br/>- update v1.2 - This app expands on v1.1 by expanding into to the use of viewHolder, RecyclerView,
	a generic reusable fragment.
	<br/>- update v1.1 - This app expands on v1.0 by wiring up the widgets in the fragment and adding
	logs to see changes to textbox and checkbox as it happens. Activity is arranged differently in land
	scape mode and the time is formatted in a more friendly way.
	<br/>- update v1.0 - A basic app that exists to demo fragments using the support library over the built
	in fragment class. Currently, this app displays a fragment with a simple edit text widget.
