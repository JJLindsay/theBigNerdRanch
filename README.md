<b>GeoQuiz v2.0</b> - This app displays how to call another activity which must call back when it
leaves the stack (ie. is finished). Intent construction encapsulation is also on display inside the 
cheat Activity. The Cheat activity builds intents for those that wish to call it and it unpacks
intents that it has created for those that need it. Intents also include exta data the next activity
might need.
